# Python 
## The Zen Of Python

#### Beautiful is better than ugly.
#### Explicit is better than implicit.
#### Simple is better than complex.
#### Complex is better than complicated.
#### Flat is better than nested.
#### Sparse is better than dense.
#### Readability counts.
#### Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
#### Although practicality beats purity.
#### Errors should never pass silently.
#### Unless explicitly silenced.
#### In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
#### There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
#### Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
#### Now is better than never.
#### Although never is often better than *right* now.
#### If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
#### If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
#### Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
